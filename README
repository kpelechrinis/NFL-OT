This repository examines the impact of receiving the kickoff in NFL OT.

The NFL-OT.csv file has the data from 142 NFL games that went to OT from 2009 to 2017 (only regular season). 

The information in the file includes home and away team, point spread from the perspective of the home team (positive: home team favorite, negative: home team underdog), the team that received the kickoff (column "coin") and the total points for the home and away team at the end of the game

The NFL_OT_coin.py processes this file and creates a model for the team that wins the overtime controling for the point spread and for the newest OT rules.

One line conclusion: in this dataset receiving the kickoff does not seem to have a statistically significant impact on winning in OT. Team strength (as captured from the point spread) is significantly correlated with winning in OT.

Between 2012 and 2017 there were 93 OT games (in regular season) and the receiving team won in 47 of them. 

Please let me know for any questions in the analysis or errors in coding the data.
